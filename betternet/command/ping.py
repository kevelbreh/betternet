    """
    The PING command is used to test the presence of an active client or
    server at the other end of the connection.  Servers send a PING
    message at regular intervals if no other activity detected coming
    from a connection.  If a connection fails to respond to a PING
    message within a set amount of time, that connection is closed.  A
    PING message MAY be sent even if the connection is active.

    When a PING message is received, the appropriate PONG message MUST be
    sent as reply to <server1> (server which sent the PING message out)
    as soon as possible.  If the <server2> parameter is specified, it
    represents the target of the ping, and the message gets forwarded
    there.

    Numeric Replies:
