Better.net
============

Like battlenet, but simpler, nicer to use, and open source.  Written in python for ease of developement. This really
needs to have a better description

TODO:

- Channel Creation
- Channel Modes
- User Modes
- Topics
- Services (IRC Services)
- Modules (Baked)
- Persistence
- Fault logging
- Performance statistics (usage, performance hit, network activity, etc)

- Friends [Add/Remove]
- Friend activity (join game, leave game)

- Games (Use a normal bot for the meanwhile).




This is for the pre-pre-pre-pre alpha where a client can log in. Get some news. Chat a bit. Perhaps join a different
channel and then quit.

Future versions I'll introduce friends and clan features, game intergration and internal match making / pickup styled 
wars.

Stat tracking!
